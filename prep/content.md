## Part A: existing technology
* First google search "Animation Apps" 
* App i looked into: <a href="https://flipaclip.com"> Flipaclip </a>
  * Beginnger friendly
  * Easy to adapt to</li>
  * Frame by frame
     * It looks a bit time consuming but if you put in the effort, it'll get paided off
 * Second app i looked into: <a href= "https://alightmotion.com/"> Alight Motion </a>
   * Looks a bit complicated
   * Accesible to everyone, it can be used on Mobile and Pc
   * From keyframe animation to video compositing to visual effects
     * From the looks of it, it seems confusing and hard to use, but theres alot of effects and tutorials to help
  * Third app i looked into: <a href= "https://procreate.com/"> Procreate </a>
   * Pros: 
     * Used for animations and digital drawings
     * Many tool options
   * Cons:
     * Not available for all
     * Needs to pay a subscription
* Second google search "Animation and time consumption"
* Website i looked into: <a href= "https://studiopigeon.com/blog/how-long-does-it-take-to-produce-an-animation/"> Studio Pigeon </a>
   * Explains about how long animation takes
   * A lot of production progress
## Part A: Hardware
What type of devices do people in animation use?
* People in animation use a wide variety of devices
    * For modern digital & 3D animation, animators use:
       * Graphic tablets, styluses, computers, desktops, Monitors, software,
     * Based on the website <a href= "https://www.cudocompute.com/blog/what-kind-of-hardware-specs-do-you-need-for-animation"> CUDO COMPUTE </a> The Optimal Hardware Specifications for Animation are:
       * Processor (CPU)- determines how quickly your computer can perform tasks. For animation, a high-speed multi-core processor is best. 
       * Graphics Card (GPU)- a graphics card or GPU, renders images, animations, and videos. A powerful GPU is essential for smooth, efficient animation creation
       * RAM- Random Access Memory (RAM) is crucial for animation processes, especially when working with high-resolution assets or complex scenes.
       * Storage- fast storage solution ensures swift loading and saves time.
    * For Traditional and stop-motion animation, animators use:
       * Paper and pencils: Traditional 2D animation still relies on basic tools like paper, pencils, and sometimes easy-erase colored pencils for sketching.
       * Animation software: Programs like Harmony or Pencil2D can be used for digital versions of traditional animation, sometimes referred to as "digital paper" or "digital animation".
       * Cameras and scanners: To digitize physical artwork, animators use cameras, scanners, or a rostrum camera to capture images frame by frame.
       * Stop-motion equipment: For stop-motion, specific setups are needed, including cameras and software, to capture and assemble the individual frames.
       * Light box/table: A portable or professional light table is essential for seeing through multiple layers of paper and cels
       * and of course, Art supplies!!
