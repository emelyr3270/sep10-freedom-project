## Overview/Introduction/Context
What is Animation?
*  Anitmation is a a way of expressing art through creating the illusion of movement by rapidly displaying a series of steady images. Theres many different types of animation such as 3D, 2D, Motion graphics, claymation, Stop motion and much more. 
*  Animation is highly driven by technology, but many people dont know what type of technology is used. Using tech helps animators create and make these drawings come to life. 
*  Now what are the tech being used to create animation?

## Animators Software
* What software do people in animation use?
    * Theres many softwares used for animation such as <a href="https://flipaclip.com"> Flipaclip </a> Its very Beginnger friendly and its Easy to adapt to. It looks a bit time consuming but if you put in the effort, it'll get paided off.

    * Another app called <a href= "https://alightmotion.com/"> Alight Motion </a> is used for motion graphics. Its used for Mobile and devices and Mac computers. From keyframe animation to video compositing to visual effects you can create anything. From the looks of it, it seems confusing and hard to use, but theres alot of effects and tutorials to help.

    * This app called <a href= "https://procreate.com/"> Procreate </a> is used for 2D Animation. Its purpose is used for both animation and digital drawings. It has many tool options, but its not available for everyone and needs a subscrition to be paid.

## Animators Hardware
What type of devices do people in animation use?
* People in animation use a wide variety of devices
    * For modern digital & 3D animation, animators use:
       * Graphic tablets, styluses, computers, desktops, Monitors, software,
     * Based on the website <a href= "https://www.cudocompute.com/blog/what-kind-of-hardware-specs-do-you-need-for-animation"> CUDO COMPUTE </a> The Optimal Hardware Specifications for Animation are:
       * Processor (CPU)- determines how quickly your computer can perform tasks. For animation, a high-speed multi-core processor is best. 
       * Graphics Card (GPU)- a graphics card or GPU, renders images, animations, and videos. A powerful GPU is essential for smooth, efficient animation creation
       * RAM- Random Access Memory (RAM) is crucial for animation processes, especially when working with high-resolution assets or complex scenes.
       * Storage- fast storage solution ensures swift loading and saves time.
    * For Traditional and stop-motion animation, animators use:
       * Paper and pencils: Traditional 2D animation still relies on basic tools like paper, pencils, and sometimes easy-erase colored pencils for sketching.
       * Animation software: Programs like Harmony or Pencil2D can be used for digital versions of traditional animation, sometimes referred to as "digital paper" or "digital animation".
       * Cameras and scanners: To digitize physical artwork, animators use cameras, scanners, or a rostrum camera to capture images frame by frame.
       * Stop-motion equipment: For stop-motion, specific setups are needed, including cameras and software, to capture and assemble the individual frames.
       * Light box/table: A portable or professional light table is essential for seeing through multiple layers of paper and cels

## Animators, prepare for the future
<h3> Future Animation Technology i have in mind: </h3>
<h4> 3Draw </h4>
3Draw is a software/hardware that createss a 3D hologram of an animation model. It'll help animators view their work in real life they can edit and create their model irl.

<h4> AniPaper </h4>
This hardware is basically a paper device that helps traditonal animators import their paper drawings on a computer. The paper device is reusable and when you draw on it, it'll be seen on the compputer. You can use materials like Paintbrushes, pencils, markers, colored penicls, or oil pastels!!
