# Entry 1: Art (animation)

<h2> Why Animation? </h2>

As an art person, the topic i decided on was animation and how its produced. It had inspired me and developed my hobby of drawing. Growing up, and as of right now, I've watched many animation movies/ series and none of them ever fail to bore me. I'm obsessed with the different types of animations, like 2D, 3D, stop motion, anime, and experimental animations. From these animations, I began to wonder what the behind the scenes looked like and how long it takes to complete a single animation video. I'm eager to learn the different techniques and tools animators use to create their projects. I'm also interested in learning how much technology is involved with animations and what other alternatives there are to create such master pieces.

The websites I'll be using that'll help me gain more knowledge will be <a href="https://www.prayananimation.com/blog/the-secrets-of-animation-a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-the-art-form/"> A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Art Form</a> & <a href="https://www.prayananimation.com/blog/how-technology-has-transformed-animation-a-look-at-the-past-present-and-future/"> How Technology Has Transformed Animation</a> from Prayan Animation, <a href="https://ghibligabble.blogspot.com/2013/04/behind-scenes-at-studio-ghibli.html"> Behind the scenes at Studio Ghibli</a> from Blogger.com.

<h2> Backup Topics </h2>

My backup ideas were psychology and astrology. These fields interest and fascinate me a lot and I wanted to dive in more deeper about those topics. I was extremely curious on how technology was used in astrology, must be a lot, right? The idea of being able to fly to the moon seems so unreal to me, which is why I wanted to explore more about it. And as for psychology, I wanted to gain more knowledge on how mental illnesses can be treated through tech. Seeing how technology has been involved and developed in many topics is interesting, but nothing beats my passion for learning technology in animation.

<h2>Engineering Design Process </h2>

I decided to start my own project to see how animators work, and let me tell you something, this is not for the impatient. Right now, I'm in the first stage of the engineering design process, which is defining the problem. The problem thatâ€™ll be investigating is, what are the BTS of animation really like and to what extent is technology a part of it. Next will explore different types of tools and advanced technologies that help the process of animation. I plan to research and look at many different websites. I'd also love to also talk to licensed animators (or any animators in general) asking them questions regarding to my topic.

<h2> Skills </h2>

<h4> How to google </h4> 
As someone who has been on the internet since such a young age, i never truly learned how to google information correctly. I've always looked at the results from "People also ask" and called it a day from there. But through my research, i've learned how to dive in deeper and ask more detailed questions to get my answer. 

<h1> Next Steps</h1>
I'm looking foward to researching the procedure of animation!
