<h3> What i discovered </h3>
<h4>Software: </h4>
Since my blog 1, ive been researching alot more about animation softwares and i would like to share the information that i have found.
In animation, theres alot of gadgets that are used. Computers and monitors are mainly used in the proccess and most people know about it, but what most people aren't familiar with are the softwares. Theres many apps for beginner animators such as <a href="https://flipaclip.com"> Flipaclip </a> Its very beginner friendly and its a 2D animation application that uses FPS (frame per second) which is a measure of how many images, or frames are displayed in a single second of a video or animation. Another application i found was <a href= "https://alightmotion.com/"> Alight Motion </a>, unlike flipaclip, its a motion graphic, animation and video editing app. It uses keyframe animation to video compositing to visual effects. Certain animation requires different softwares including, <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/education/home"> Autodesk </a>. Autodesk is used for advanced animators, professionals in a wide range of industries, like architecture and engineering!! This software company creates and provides computer-aided design (CAD) and other 3D design, engineering, and entertainment software. Most people don't how much proccess it takes to create a simple video! 
<h4> hardware: </h4>
Now that ive researched the applications and software animators use, i've also researched what hardware they use. People in animation use a wide variety of devices, for modern digital & 3D animation, animators use: Graphic tablets, styluses, computers, desktops, Monitors, software. But if we dive in more, they use specific hardware like a Processor (CPU)- determines how quickly your computer can perform tasks. For animation, a high-speed multi-core processor is best. They also use a Graphics Card (GPU) It renders images, animations, and videos. A powerful GPU is essential for smooth, efficient animation creation. A Random Access Memory (RAM) is crucial for animation processes, especially when working with high-resolution assets or complex scenes. For Traditional and stop-motion animation, animators ofcourse use paper, pencil and stop-motion equipment. But what i found interesting was a Light box/table. Its a portable or professional light table is essential for seeing through multiple layers of paper and i think this is a very useful creation for animators. Back in the good ol days, Animators in Disney developed Multiplane camera. Its a camera that could photograph multiple layers of artwork at different distances from the camera, creating a sense of depth and parallax in 2D animation. A more modern gadget would be SANDDE (Stereo Animation Drawing Device) Its a system that allows animators to draw and animate in a 3D space, essentially a 3D animation system that works by drawing in space. And i think that its so cool!! Seeing how technology has developed overtime is really interesting and has me wondering what other things us humans can create. 

<h3> How i found this </h3>
Researching has become more simpler for me since my last blog. I would search up "Animation software/hardware" or "Animation gadgets". I saw many cool things and visited animation websites that helped me with my research. To get a more specific result, I would search up "unknown gadgets used in animation" and "animation software people dont know of". I asked my friends if they knew what software it was to make sure it wasnt so known. 

<h2> Engineering Design Process </h2>
So, im currently on the stage of researching on my EDP. I really liked this stage because I got to research and learn many new things about animation that i wasnt familiar with. Through these searches, i found how animation is also linked with other industries. I also learned how much technology has developed overtime through animation.

<h2> Skills </h2>
<h3> Self-motivation:</h3> 
Most people have a struggle with self motivation, I found out how to self motivate myself by setting a timer. It helped me stay on task and complete my homework on a certain amount of time. Other than school work, I was in my tennis school team for fall season, and during practice I would remind myself that others are counting on me and that a simple mistake shouldn't define me at that moment. I learned to continue going!!
<h3>Note taking: </h3>
For this blog, note taking was really helpful. I was able to input my research of hardware and software. It helped me by giving me a heads up on what to write. Note taking was also helpful when completing SEP and other school work. Looking back at notes refreshes my brain on what i learned so i could use it.

<h2> Next steps! </h2>
Next, i'll continue looking for new information to help me with my topic and Brainstorm possible solutions.
