## How i brainstormed part B

For this part of my project, I thought of future ideas that'll help Animators have a more efficient and easy way in creating animation. The main thing that I thought of was how can traditional artists import their work onto a device? while researching, i discovered that theres been an invention similar to my idea. The E-ink tablets (also known as eNotes and ePaper) are electronic tablets that can be used for writing and sketching using a stylus. Its seen as a an infinite sack of paper and are often used as a replacement for traditional notepads and sketchbooks. I thought of changing it up a notch, my idea consists of creating a paper device where you can use any kind of physical art materials and import the drawing onto a software device. The paper device is reusable and when you draw on it, it'll be seen on the computer. I think it would be an efficient way for traditional artists to create animations. What also helped me brainstorm was seeing past students freedom projects that chose the same/similar topic as me. I came across this student named eva and their project was based on graphic design. They came up with a 3D Hologram. I also thought of creating a software/hardware called 3Draw. It creates a 3D hologram of an animation model and It'll help animators view their work in real life where they can edit and create their model.

## Sources

To help me brainstorm my ideas, I looked for any recent tools that helps with animation. I came across this website called <a href= "https://remarkable.com/"> reMarkable </a>. Its a digital notebook designed for a distraction-free writing, sketching, and reading experience that mimics the feel of paper. It uses a paper-like E Ink display and a special stylus to provide a natural writing feel without the distractions of a typical tablet. There was also this website that i found called <a href= "https://ewritable.net/best-tablets/"> EWritable </a> where it shows different types of tablets related to a paper like device. Looking at past students projects, I found someones work whos topic is similar to mine, they chose <a href= "https://evac2742.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/"> Graphic Designs </a> and it was really helpful to see other peoples ideas that helped me brainstorm my ideas. 

## Engineering Design Process 

Currently, Im in the brainstorming stage of my EDP. By doing this, i researched tools/hardwares and softwares that already exists that help animators create their animation. I then thought of ways that could help animators speed up their process and combinding a mixture of traditional and digital animation. Then i planned innovations that weren't created yet.
